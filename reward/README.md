# README for reward function

## How to define reward function

ChemTSv2 frexibly accept user-defined reward file written in Python3.
A user-defined class should inherit from a [Reward base class](./reward.py).
The reward class contains two static methods: `get_objective_functions()` and `calc_reward_from_objective_values()`.
The former method takes a configuration parameter object in a dictionary format, has at least one inner function that calculates an objective value from a `Mol` object of RDKit, and returns a list of inner functions.
The latter method takes a list of calculated objective values and the parameter object and returns a float value.

Below is a simple example using only Python packages:

```python
import sys
import numpy as np
from rdkit.Chem import Descriptors
import sascorer
from reward.reward import Reward

class Jscore_reward(Reward):
    def get_objective_functions(conf):
        def LogP(mol):
            return Descriptors.MolLogP(mol)
        def SAScore(mol):
            return sascorer.calculateScore(mol)
        def RingSizePenalty(mol):
            ri = mol.GetRingInfo()
            max_ring_size = max((len(r) for r in ri.AtomRings()), default=0)
            return max_ring_size - 6
        return [LogP, SAScore, RingSizePenalty]

    def calc_reward_from_objective_values(values, conf):
        logP, sascore, ring_size_penalty = values
        jscore = logP - sascore - ring_size_penalty
        return jscore / (1 + abs(jscore))
```

If you want to use external software packages, such as Gaussian 16 and AutoDock Vina, you can use them in the reward file using `subprocess` Python module (cf. [Vina_binary_reward.py](./Vina_binary_reward.py))

## Additional packages for prepared reward files

### dscore_reward.py

```bash
pip install lightgbm
```

### Vina_binary_reward.py

```bash
pip install meeko
```

Need to install AutoDock Vina (v1.2.3) on your computer. Please download and install it. https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-Vina/releases

### Vina_reward.py

AutoDock Vina also provides the Python package, but the above binary version is more stable in ChemTSv2.

```bash
pip install vina
pip install meeko 
```

### fluor_reward.py and chro_reward.py

To facilitate the execution of Gaussian 16 software, ChemTSv2 utilizes [QCforever](https://github.com/molecule-generator-collection/QCforever). 
First, you need to install Gaussian 16 software, and then, just run the following command to install QCforever.

```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/molecule-generator-collection/QCforever.git
```

### Vina_use_appropriate_lingand3d_reward.py

This reward function need AutoDock Vina Python package and openbabel binary.
Below is the command to install AutoDock Vina Python package.

```bash
pip install vina, meeko, scipy
```

Below is the example of command to install openbabel binary.
In detail, please refer to the official instruction (https://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Installation/install.html#basic-build-procedure).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/
cd openbabel
mkdir build; cd build
cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=(/path/to/install/)
make
make install
```

### gnina_singularity_reward.py

This reward function need gnina and Singularity.

How to setup:

```bash
pip install spython
singularity build reward/gnina.sif docker://gnina/gnina:latest
```

How to run:

```bash
chemtsv2 -c config/setting_gnina_singularity.yaml --gpu 0 --use_gpu_only_reward
```

### gnina_rmsd_reward.py

This reward function calculates ligand RMSD of the common molecular scaffold between a docking pose and reference structure. When using this function, note the following.

1. When using a ligand from a crystal structure, outputted using Pymol, as the reference structure, please convert it using Open Babel as follows:

```bash
obabel -ipdb ligand.pdb -omol -O ligand.mol
```

2. This reward function doesn't take into account the inversion of symmetrical structure caused by a single bond when calculates RMSD.

### gnina_strain_reward.py

This reward function need  StrainFilter distributed at [Tldr's a Ligand Discovery Resource](https://tldr.docking.org/).
Using this reward fucntion, you need to create Tldr account at [Tldr Web site](https://tldr.docking.org/) with the agreement of the Tldr's license, and activate the account after getting permission by the Irwin and Shoichet Laboratories. After finishing the installation of STRAIN_FILTER directory, please move it to ChemTSv2/data/

You also need to install openbabel. Click [here](#here) for instllation instructions.

Strainfilter is licensed by the [Irwin](https://irwinlab.compbio.ucsf.edu/) and [Shoichet](https://bkslab.org/) Laboratories in the Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).
